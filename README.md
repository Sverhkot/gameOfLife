# The Game of Life

This repository contains my javascript implementation of a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Game Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
